# Build a Calculator with CSS Grid

## The Challenge

CSS grid is incredibly useful at laying elements out in a... you guessed it, a grid! I recently made this calculator as prep for an upcoming Vue course. The CSS grid helped layout all the buttons quickly and easily.

This calculator was easy to layout thanks to CSS grid and could be achieved in as little as 10 lines of code. You'll need more to style out the calculator itself but the grid part is achieved succinctly.
